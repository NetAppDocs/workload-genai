There are certain Workload Factory resources and requirements that you'll need before you begin to build your knowledge base. This includes having a Workload Factory account, credentials that allow Workload Factory to manage AWS resources, and more.
 
Workload Factory account::
You'll need to log in and create a Workload Factory account.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/sign-up-saas.html[Learn more about logging in and creating an account].

Credentials:: 
You'll need to use Workload Factory with an embedded set of AWS credentials and permissions into your Workload Factory account. This is called _Automate_ mode so that Workload Factory can perform all actions in your AWS environment.
+
_Basic_ mode and _Read_ mode permissions are not supported at this time.
//This is called _Basic_ mode. However, by adding AWS credentials and permissions, you enable Workload Factory to manage the deployment and management of AWS resources directly from the Workload Factory UI. You can add _Read_ mode permissions to grant Workload Factory the ability to read information about your AWS resources.
+
When setting up your credentials, selecting permissions as shown below provides you with full access to manage FSx for ONTAP systems and to deploy and manage the GenAI EC2 instance and other AWS resources needed for your knowledge base and chatbot.
