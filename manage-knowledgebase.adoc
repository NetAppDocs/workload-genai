After you create a knowledgebase, you can view the knowledgebase details, modify the knowledgebase, integrate additional data sources, or delete the knowledgebase.

== View information about a knowledgebase

You can view information about the settings for a knowledgebase and the data source that are integrated.

.Steps

. Launch Workload Factory.

. In the AI workloads tile, click *Deploy & manage*. 

. Click *Create chatbot* and the Knowledgebases inventory page is displayed.

. Select the knowledgebase that you want to view.
+
If defined, the conversation starters that are currently being used display in the right pane.

. To view knowledgebase details, click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Manage knowledgebase*.
+
This page displays the published status, embedding status of the data sources, embedding mode, the list of all embedded data sources, and more.
+
The *Actions* menu enables you to manage the knowledgebase if you want to make any changes.

== Edit a knowledgebase

You can update a knowledgebase by changing some settings, or you can add or remove data sources.

Each time you add, modify, or remove data sources from the knowledgebase, you must sync the data source so that it is re-indexed to the knowledgebase. Syncing is incremental, so Amazon Bedrock only processes the objects in your FSx for ONTAP volume that have been added, modified, or deleted since the last sync.

.Steps

. From the Knowledgebases inventory page, select the knowledgebase that you want to update.

. Click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Manage knowledgebase*.
+
This page displays the published status, embedding status of the data sources, embedding mode, the list of all embedded data sources, and more.

. Click the *Actions* menu and select *Edit knowledgebase*.

. In the Edit knowledgebase page, you can change the knowledgebase name, description, chat model, and whether conversation starter are created automatically or manually.
+
If you use Manual mode for conversation starters, you can change conversation starter here as well.

. Click *Save* after you have made your changes.

== Delete a knowledgebase

If you no longer need a knowledgebase, you can delete it. When you delete the knowledgebase, it will be removed from Workload Factory and any applications or chatbots that are using the knowledgebase will stop working. This action is not reversible.

When you delete a knowledgebase, you should also carry out the following actions to fully delete all resources associated with the knowledgebase.

* Dissociate the knowledgebase from any agents it is associated with.
* The underlying data that was indexed from your knowledgebase remains in the vector store you set up and can still be retrieved. To delete the data, you also need to delete the vector index containing the data embeddings.

.Steps

. From the Knowledgebases inventory page, select the knowledgebase that you want to delete.

. Click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Manage knowledgebase*.

. Click the *Actions* menu and select *Delete knowledgebase*.

. In the Delete knowledgebase dialog, confirm that you want to delete it and click *Delete*.

.Result

The knowledgebase is deleted from Workload Factory.
