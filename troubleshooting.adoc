|Area |Issue |Cause |Workaround

|Deployment
|Deployment fails because the volume already exists.
|BlueXP workload factory for GenAI needs to create a new volume during the deployment process, but a volume already exists using the name you have specified.
|Specify a unique name to use for the new volume, and try deploying again.

|Deployment
|The deployment fails because BlueXP workload factory for GenAI is unable to mount the volume.
|One or more of the inbound ports required for FSx for NetApp ONTAP are closed or filtered.

|Maintenance
|The AI engine fails to start, and you see the error "AI engine instance error" on the *Knowledge bases* page.
|The AI engine instance was corrupted or doesn't exist.
|Select the *Rebuild* button. BlueXP workload factory for GenAI rebuilds the infrastructure and displays the rebuild progress. When complete, your knowledge bases are reconnected to the rebuilt infrastructure and the list of knowledge bases is displayed.

|Maintenance
|The backend Docker instance used by BlueXP workload factory for GenAI failed to start.
|The volume was deleted and the EC2 instance was restarted.
a|Use the following recovery steps:

.Steps
. Create a new volume on FSx for NetApp ONTAP. For example, the volume name can be `netapp_ai` and the volume path can be `/netapp_ai`.
. SSH to the Amazon EC2 instance.
. List the volumes:
+
[source,console]
----
docker volume list
----
. Remove the old volume:
+
[source,console]
----
docker volume rm ec2-user_persistent_folder
----
. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file using a text editor.
. In the `volumes` section, change the device path to the new volume path. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
---- 
volumes:
  persistent_folder:
    driver_opts:
      type: 'nfs'
      o: "addr=svm-0df66b96a890d8a72.\
      fs-0d673008aaca12bc3.\
      fsx.us-east-1.amazonaws.com,nolock,soft,rw"
      device: ':/netapp_ai' # Path to new volume
----

|Maintenance
|The backend Docker instance used by BlueXP workload factory for GenAI failed to start.
|The root volume was deleted.
|Create a volume with a name and path, and then restart the backend Docker instance from Amazon EC2.
