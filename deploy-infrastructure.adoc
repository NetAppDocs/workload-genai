You need to deploy the chatbot infrastructure in your environment before you can build chatbots for your organization. The infrastructure consists of the Amazon Bedrock AI service, a virtual machine instance for the NetApp AI engine, and an FSx for ONTAP file system.

The deployed infrastructure can support multiple chatbots, so you'll typically only need to perform this task once.

== Infrastructure details

The infrastructure consists of the following components.

Amazon Bedrock service::
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that enables you to use foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies via a single API. It also provides the capabilities you need to build secure generative AI applications.

Virtual machine for the NetApp AI engine::
The NetApp AI engine gets deployed during this process. It provides the processing power to ingest the data from your data sources and then write that data in the database.

FSx for ONTAP file system::
The FSx for ONTAP system provides the storage for your AI system. 
+
* One volume contains the data sources that will be integrated into your chatbot.
* One volume contains the database that stores the data that has been generated by the foundational model based on your data sources.
+
The NetApp AI engine monitors and interacts with both of these volumes.

== Deploy the infrastructure

You'll choose the data sources to integrate in your chatbot, and the Bedrock AI models that you want to use to create your chatbot.
