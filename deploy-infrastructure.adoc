You need to deploy the chatbot infrastructure in your environment before you can build chatbots for your organization. The infrastructure consists of the Amazon Bedrock AI service, a virtual machine instance for the NetApp AI engine, and an FSx for ONTAP file system.

The deployed infrastructure can support multiple chatbots, so you'll typically only need to perform this task once.

== Infrastructure details

The infrastructure consists of the following components.

Amazon Bedrock service::
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that enables you to use foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies via a single API. It also provides the capabilities you need to build secure generative AI applications.
+

Virtual machine for the NetApp AI engine::
The NetApp AI engine gets deployed during this process. It provides the processing power to ingest the data from your data sources and then write that data in the database.

FSx for ONTAP file system::
The FSx for ONTAP system provides the storage for your AI system. 
+
* One volume contains the data sources that will be integrated into your chatbot.
* One volume contains the database that stores the data that has been generated by the foundational model based on your data sources.
+
The NetApp AI engine monitors and interacts with both of these volumes.

== Deploy the infrastructure

You'll choose the data sources to integrate in your chatbot, and the Bedrock AI models that you want to use to create your chatbot.

.Before you begin

See "Requirements" for information about setting up the FSx for ONTAP file system and Amazon Bedrock.

.Steps

. Log in to Workload Factory.

. In the AI workloads tile, click *Deploy & manage* and the Deploy chatbot infrastructure page is displayed.

. Review the infrastructure diagram and click *Next*. 

. Complete the items in the "AWS settings" section of the Define infrastructure page: 

.. *AWS credentials*. When running in Read, or Automate mode, select or add the AWS credentials that provide permissions to deploy the AWS resources. 
+
When running in Basic mode you can continue without credentials, but you'll need to copy the code in the Codebox for CloudFormation and adding credentials after you're logged into AWS.

.. *Location*. Select the AWS region, VPC and Subnet. 
+
Your instance of Amazon Bedrock must be location in the same region and VPC.

. Complete the items in the "Infrastructure settings" section of the Define infrastructure page: 

.. *FSx for ONTAP system*. Select the FSx for ONTAP system and the storage VM where the AI instance database volumes will be deployed, and then specify the name you want to use for the volume.
+
Depending on whether or not Workload Factory has the credentials, you may need to enter the user name and password for the FSx for ONTAP system.

.. *Tags*. Enter any tag key/value pairs that you want to have applied to all the AWS resources that are part of this deployment.

. *Key pair*. Select a key pair that allows you to securely connet to the NetApp AI engine instance.

. Click *Deploy* to begin the deployment.

.Result

The chatbot infrastructure is deployed and you can start to build your first chatbot.

During the deployment process, the following items are set up:

* The network is set up along with the private endpoints.
* The IAM role, instance profile, and security group are created.
* The volumes for the AI engine databases are created.
* The instance for the AI engine is deployed.
