== Remove the infrastructure

If you no longer need the chatbot infrastructure that you deployed for one or more chatbots, you can remove it from Workload Factory. 

NOTE: All chatbots that have been deployed on this infrastructure will be disabled and all chat history will be deleted.

This operation only removes the links to the AI infrastructure from Workload Factory--it does not remove all the components from AWS. You'll need to manually delete the following infrastructure components from AWS:

* The VM instance
* Private endpoints
* The volume on the FSx for ONTAP file system that contains the AI databases
* The IAM role
* The policy
* The security group


.Steps

. Log in to Workload Factory.

. In the AI workloads tile, click *Deploy & manage*. 

. Select the Infrastructure tab.

. Click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Remove infrastructure*.

. Verify that you want to remove the infrastructure.


.Result

The chatbot infrastructure components are removed from Workload Factory.
