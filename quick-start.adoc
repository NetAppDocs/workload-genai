Get started creating a knowledge base using your organization's data that exists on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP datastores. An application such as a chatbot will access this knowledge base to provide organization-focused responses to end users.

Before you get started, you should have a https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/workload-factory-accounts.html[Workload Factory account].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need to have AWS credentials to deploy the AWS infrastructure, you'll need to have deployed and discovered an FSx for ONTAP file system, you'll need the list of data sources you want to integrate in your knowledge base, access to the Amazon Bedrock AI service, and more.

Review the link:aws-requirements.html[AWS requirements] and the link:workload-factory-requirements.html[Workload Factory requirements] needed to build and manage your knowledge base.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The data sources that you'll integrate in your knowledge base can be located on a single FSx for ONTAP system, or on multiple FSx for ONTAP systems. These systems can be in different VPCs, but they must be accessible within the same network.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Deploy the knowledge base infrastructure

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Launch the infrastructure deployment wizard to deploy the knowledge base infrastructure in your AWS environment. This process deploys an EC2 instance for the NetApp GenAI engine, and a volume on an FSx for ONTAP file system to contain the NetApp AI Engine databases. The volume is used to store the vector database used by the knowledge base.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Launch the knowledge base definition wizard to identify the data sources from your FSx for ONTAP volumes that will be integrated into your knowledge base and define the AI characteristics.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Create conversation starters and test the chatbot interaction with your knowledge base locally before integrating the knowledge base with an application.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-6.png[Six] Publish your knowledge base

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Publish your knowledge base so that it is externally available so you can connect the knowledge base with your GenAI application.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The application will interact with your knowledge base to return customized responses to your users.
