Ensure that Workload Factory and AWS are set up properly before you build your knowledge base. This includes having your AWS log in credentials, a deployed FSx for ONTAP file system that contains the data sources you want to integrate in your knowledge base, access to the Amazon Bedrock AI service, and more.

Workload Factory account::
You'll need to log in and create a Workload Factory account.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/sign-up-saas.html[Learn more about logging in and creating an account^]

AWS credentials:: 
You need to add AWS credentials to Workload Factory with automate-level permissions, which means you'll be using Workload Factory in _automate_ mode for GenAI.
+
_Basic_ mode and _Read_ mode permissions are not supported at this time.
+
When setting up your credentials, selecting permissions as shown below provides you with full access to manage FSx for ONTAP file systems and to deploy and manage the GenAI EC2 instance and other AWS resources needed for your knowledge base and chatbot.

AWS region::
Your GenAI deployment must be in an AWS region that has Amazon Bedrock enabled. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-supported.html[View the list of supported regions^]

Amazon Bedrock::
Amazon Bedrock enables you to use foundation models and it provides the capabilities to build generative AI applications. 
+
You'll need an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that provides Amazon Bedrock permission to access other AWS resources and services.
+

Chat model::
You must enable the foundational chat model that you plan to use before creating your knowledge base. 
+
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html[Learn about the supported foundational models^]
+
You can link:manage-knowledgebase.html#evaluate-chat-models-before-creating-a-knowledge-base[evaluate chat models] before creating a knowledge base to see which model is best for your requirements.

FSx for ONTAP file system::
You need a minimum of one FSx for ONTAP file system:
+
* One file system will be used by the NetApp GenAI engine to store the vector database used by the knowledge base. 
+
This FSx for ONTAP file system must use FlexVol volumes. FlexGroup volumes are not supported.

* One or more file systems will contain the data sources that you'll be integrating into your knowledge base. 
+
One FSx for ONTAP file system can be used for both of these purposes, or you can use multiple FSx for ONTAP file systems.

* You'll need to know the AWS region, VPC, and subnet where the AWS FSx for ONTAP file system resides. The file system must be in an AWS region that has Amazon Bedrock enabled.

* You'll need to know the tag key/value pairs that you want to apply to the AWS resources that are part of this deployment (optional).

* You'll need to know the key pair information that allows you to securely connect to the NetApp AI engine instance.
