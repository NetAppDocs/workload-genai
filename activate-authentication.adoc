Activate authentication for a knowledge base so that token validation and ACLs are required when using the API endpoints to integrate a knowledge base with a chatbot application.

.Steps

. From the Knowledge bases inventory page, select the knowledge base for which you want to activate authentication.

. Select image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Manage knowledge base*.

. Select the *Actions* menu and select *Manage authentication settings*.

. Set up authentication:

.. Select *Activate authentication settings*.
.. Provide the required information. Examples are provided, but you should obtain the values for these fields from your authentication provider:
+
* *Algorithms*: Choose the algorithm that your provider uses.
* *Audience* (Optional): The intended recipient of the authentication token.
* *Issuer*: A string that identifies the provider that issued the token. 
+
For example, Amazon Cognito uses issuer strings that follow the following format:
+
----
https://cognito-idp-<region>.amazonaws.com/<UserPoolID>
----
+
Where `<region>` is the AWS region containing the user pool, and `<UserPoolID>` is your user pool ID. You can retrieve your user pool ID using the following command:
+
----
aws cognito-idp list-user-pools --max-results=60 --output=table
----
* *JWKS URI*: The URI string that provides public keys needed to verify signatures of this token.
+
For example, Amazon Cognito uses the following string format for the JWKS URI:
+
----
https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<userPoolId>/.well-known/jwks.json
----
+
Where `<region>` is the AWS region containing the user pool, and `<UserPoolID>` is your user pool ID.

. Select *Save*.

.Result

Authentication for the knowledge base is now active, and you can use API endpoints to interact with the knowledge base and integrate the knowledge base with a chatbot application.
