After you've built and tested your knowledge base locally, you can publish the knowledge base so that it can be integrated with the chatbot application that will enable your users to query the knowledge base.

Publishing the knowledge base enables you to use it in chat applications. The publish action triggers the API to generate and publish a unique endpoint. After publishing, the knowledge base becomes accessible for chat applications, and the API endpoint is ready for integration.

Each knowledge base that you publish has a unique endpoint.
