You can view details about your deployed GenAI RAG infrastructure or remove the chatbot infrastructure if you no longer need it.

You can view information about the chatbot infrastructure.

. From the Workload Factory navigation menu, select *AI*.

. Select the *Infrastructure* tab.

. View information about the infrastructure, which includes details about the following components:
+
* AWS settings
* Infrastructure settings
//* The FSx for ONTAP file system
* The AI engine
* The vector database

== Remove the infrastructure

If you no longer need the chatbot infrastructure that you deployed for one or more chatbots, you can remove it from Workload Factory. 

NOTE: All chatbots that have been deployed on this infrastructure will be disabled and all chat history will be deleted.

This operation only removes the links to the AI infrastructure from Workload Factory; it does not remove all the components from AWS. You'll need to manually delete the following infrastructure components from AWS:

* The VM instance
* Private endpoints
* The volume on the FSx for ONTAP file system that contains the AI databases
* The IAM role
* The policy
* The security group
