summary: Ensure that Workload Factory and AWS are set up properly before you build your knowledge base. This includes having your AWS log in credentials, a deployed FSx for ONTAP file system that contains the data sources you want to integrate in your knowledge base, access to the Amazon Bedrock AI service, and more.

Ensure that Workload Factory and AWS are set up properly before you create a NetApp Connector for Amazon Q Business. 

== Basic GenAI requirements
GenAI has general requirements that your environment needs to meet before you get started.

Workload factory login and account::
You'll need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/sign-up-saas.html[set up an account with Workload Factory^] and log in using one of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].

AWS credentials and permissions::
You need to add AWS credentials to Workload Factory with read/write permissions, which means you'll be using Workload Factory in _read/write_ mode for GenAI.
+
_Basic_ mode and _read-only_ mode permissions are not supported at this time.
+
When setting up your credentials, selecting permissions as shown below provides you with full access to manage FSx for ONTAP file systems and to deploy and manage the GenAI EC2 instance and other AWS resources needed for your knowledge base and chatbot.

== Requirements for NetApp Connector for Amazon Q Business
Ensure your environment meets the following specific requirements for Amazon Q Business connectors.

Amazon Q Business application::
You need to create an Amazon Q Business application or use an existing one.

* Ensure that the application exists in one of your AWS regions.
* Ensure that you have https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/select-retriever.html[created an index^] for the application. 
* Ensure that the application is not in a failed state.

FSx for ONTAP file system::
You need a minimum of one FSx for ONTAP file system:
+
* One file system will be used (or created, if it doesn't exist) by the NetApp GenAI engine to store information about the connector. 
+
This FSx for ONTAP file system must use FlexVol volumes. FlexGroup volumes are not supported.

* One or more file systems will contain the data sources that you'll be adding to your connector. 
+
One FSx for ONTAP file system can be used for both of these purposes, or you can use multiple FSx for ONTAP file systems.

* You'll need to know the AWS region, VPC, and subnet where the AWS FSx for ONTAP file system resides.

* You'll need to consider the tag key/value pairs that you want to apply to the AWS resources that are part of this deployment (optional).

* You'll need to know the key pair information that allows you to securely connect to the NetApp AI engine instance.
