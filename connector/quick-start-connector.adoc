Get started creating a NetApp Connector for Amazon Q Business using your organization's data that exists on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems. After you create a connector, end users can access the Amazon Q Business assistant for organization-focused responses to their questions.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The data sources that you'll integrate in your connector can be located on a single FSx for ONTAP file system, or on multiple FSx for ONTAP file systems. If these systems are in different VPCs, they must either be accessible within the same network, or the VPCs must be peered and using the same region and AWS account as the AI engine.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Launch the infrastructure deployment wizard to deploy the GenAI infrastructure in your AWS environment. This process deploys an EC2 instance for the NetApp GenAI engine, and a volume on an FSx for ONTAP file system to contain the NetApp AI Engine databases. The volume is used to store information about the connector.
