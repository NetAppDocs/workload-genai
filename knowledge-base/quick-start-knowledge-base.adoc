Get started creating a knowledge base or Amazon Q Business connector using your organization's data that exists on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems. An application such as a chatbot will access this knowledge base or connector to provide organization-focused responses to end users.

You'll need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/sign-up-saas.html[set up an account with Workload Factory^] and log in using one of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need AWS credentials to deploy the AWS infrastructure, a deployed and discovered FSx for ONTAP file system, the list of data sources that you want to integrate in your knowledge base or connector, access to the Amazon Bedrock AI service or Amazon Q Business application, and more.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The data sources that you'll integrate in your knowledge base can be located on a single FSx for ONTAP file system, or on multiple FSx for ONTAP file systems. If these systems are in different VPCs, they must either be accessible within the same network, or the VPCs must be peered and using the same region and AWS account as the AI engine.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Launch the infrastructure deployment wizard to deploy the GenAI infrastructure in your AWS environment. This process deploys an EC2 instance for the NetApp GenAI engine, and a volume on an FSx for ONTAP file system to contain the NetApp AI Engine databases. The volume is used to store the vector database used by the knowledge base.

.What's next

You can now build a knowledge base to provide organization-focused responses to end users.
