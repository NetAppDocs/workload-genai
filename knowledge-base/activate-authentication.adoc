Activate authentication for a knowledge base so that token validation and ACLs are required when using the API endpoints to integrate a knowledge base with a chatbot application. When you activate authentication, you configure settings for a JSON Web Token that will be used for API requests to a knowledge base from chatbot clients.

.Steps

. Log in to workload factory using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].

. From the Knowledge bases inventory page, select the knowledge base for which you want to activate authentication.

. Select image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Manage knowledge base*.

. Select the *Actions* menu and select *Manage authentication settings*.

. Set up authentication:

.. Select *Activate authentication settings*.
.. Provide the required information. Examples are provided, but you should obtain the values for these fields from your authentication provider:
+
* *Algorithms*: The signing algorithm that your authentication provider uses.
* *Audience* (Optional): A string containing the intended recipient of the token (sometimes a URL).
* *Issuer*: A string that identifies the provider that issued the token. 
+
For example, Amazon Cognito uses issuer strings with the following format:
+
----
https://cognito-idp-<region>.amazonaws.com/<UserPoolID>
----
+
Where `<region>` is the AWS region containing the user pool, and `<UserPoolID>` is your user pool ID. You can retrieve your user pool ID using the following command:
+
----
aws cognito-idp list-user-pools --max-results=60 --output=table
----
* *JWKS URI*: The URI string that provides public keys needed to verify signatures of this token.
+
For example, Amazon Cognito uses JWKS URI strings with the following format:
+
----
https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<userPoolId>/.well-known/jwks.json
----
+
Where `<region>` is the AWS region containing the user pool, and `<UserPoolID>` is your user pool ID. You can retrieve your user pool ID using the following command:
+
----
aws cognito-idp list-user-pools --max-results=60 --output=table
----

. Select *Save*.

.Result

Authentication for the knowledge base is now active, and you can use API endpoints to interact with the knowledge base and integrate the knowledge base with a chatbot application.
