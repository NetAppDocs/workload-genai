summary: You'll need to set up or verify many items before you can deploy a chatbot based on your knowledgebase. This includes having your AWS credentials and permissions to deploy the AWS infrastructure, an FSx for ONTAP file system, the list of data sources you want to integrate in your knowledgebase, access to the Amazon Bedrock AI service, and more.

You'll need to set up or verify many items before you can deploy a chatbot based on your knowledgebase. This includes having your AWS credentials and permissions to deploy the AWS infrastructure, an FSx for ONTAP file system, the list of data sources you want to integrate in your knowledgebase, access to the Amazon Bedrock AI service, and more.
 
== Workload Factory requirements

Workload Factory account::
You'll need to log in and create a Workload Factory account.
+

Credentials:: 
You can use Workload Factory without embedding a set of AWS credentials and permissions into your Workload Factory account. Adding AWS credentials and permissions enables Workload Factory to manage the deployment and management of AWS resources directly from the Workload Factory UI.
+
When setting up your credentials, selecting permissions as shown below provide you with full access to manage FSx for ONTAP systems and to deploy and the AI EC2 instance and other AWS resources needed for your knowledgebase and chatbot.

== AWS requirements

* AWS credentials. You'll need your AWS credential whether you plan to have Workload Factory deploy and manage AWS resources, or whether you plan to log in to AWS and use the CLI or CloudFormation to manage AWS resources.
* AWS permissions and user. 
* Amazon Bedrock service subscription
+
Amazon Bedrock enables you to use foundation models and it provides the capabilities to build generative AI applications. You'll need an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that provides Amazon Bedrock permission to access other AWS resources and services. https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/[Learn more about Amazon Bedrock].
* FSx for ONTAP file system
+
The system contains the data sources that you'll be integrating into your knowledgebase. It will also need to have enough free capacity so that the database that stores the data generated by the foundational model can be saved to a new volume.
+
You'll need to know the AWS region, VPC, and Subnet where the AWS FSx for ONTAP system resides.
* You'll need to know the tag key/value pairs that you want to apply to the AWS resources that are part of this deployment (optional).
* You'll need to know the Key pair that allows you to securely connect to the NetApp AI engine instance.
