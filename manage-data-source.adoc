After you create a knowledge base using data sources on your FSx for ONTAP system, you can view the data source details, update or change the data source contents, edit data source settings, or delete the data source.

== View information about a data source

You can view information about the contents of a data source and you can view its embedding status with the knowledge base. Since a data source is part of a knowledge base, you'll need to open the knowledge base first before you can view the data source details.

.Steps

. Launch Workload Factory.

. In the AI workloads tile, click *Deploy & manage*. 

. Click *Create chatbot* and the Knowledge bases page is displayed.

. Select the knowledge base where the data source resides, and then click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Manage knowledge base*.
+
The bottom part of the page lists the data sources that are part of this knowledge base.

. Expand each row by clicking the image:button_down_caret.png[the down-arrow button] to view detailed information about each data source, such as the FSx for ONTAP system, the volume, and the path where the data source resides. 
+
It also lists the embedding information and whether that data source is currently embedded in the knowledge base.

== Edit data source settings

You can edit information about a data source that you've integrated in a knowledge base. Most of the information is fixed after you've added a data source to a knowledge base, but you can make changes to the chunking definition, and to the permission awareness (when using SMB protocol on the data source volume).

.Steps

. From the knowledge base inventory page, select the knowledge base where the data source resides, and then click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Manage knowledge base*.
+
The bottom part of the page lists the data sources that are part of this knowledge base.

. In the row of the data source that you want to edit, click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Edit data source*.

. In the Edit data source page, click image:button_down_caret.png[the down-arrow button] to expand the row for Chunk definition.

. Update the settings for the Chunking strategy and Chunk size, and permission awareness (for SMB volumes) and click *Save*.

.Result 

The data source settings are updated and the AI system synchronizes the data source so that it is re-indexed to the knowledge base.

== Update the contents of an existing data source

You can change the contents of a data source at any time to add or update your organizational data. If this data source is being actively used in a knowledge base, you must sync the data source so that it is re-indexed to the knowledge base. Syncing is incremental, so Amazon Bedrock only processes the objects in your FSx for ONTAP volume that have been added, modified, or deleted since the last sync.

.Steps

. If necessary, 

== Delete a data source

If you no longer need a data source to be part of your knowledge base, you can delete it.

.Steps

. From the knowledge base inventory page, select the knowledge base where the data source resides, and then click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Manage knowledge base*.
+
The bottom part of the page lists the data sources that are part of this knowledge base.

. In the row of the data source that you want to delete, click image:icon-action.png[the option button] and select *Delete*.

. In the Delete data source dialog, confirm that you want to delete it and click *Delete*.

.Result

The data source is removed from the knowledge base and the AI system removes the indexed information about this data source from the knowledge base. Any information from the data source will be unavailable to chatbots that are using the knowledge base.



=== Add additional data sources to a knowledge base

Here or KB topic??

.Steps

. Log in to Workload Factory.

. In the AI workloads tile, click *Deploy & manage*. 

. Click *Create chatbot* and the xyz page is displayed

. Click *Add data source* to 

. Select the FSx for ONTAP file system where your data source files reside and click *Next*.

. Select the volume on which your data source files reside and click *Next*.

. Select the data source location based on where you have saved the files. This can be the entire volume or just a specific folder or sub-folder in the volume, and click *Next*.

. In the Models section of the Define AI parameters page, define the models:

.. For Embedding model you can select the "Titan Embeddings G1" at this point.
.. For Text model you can choose from a variety of Claude and Jurassic AI models. Learn mode about https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/[Claude on Bedrock^] and https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/jurassic/[Jurassic on Bedrock^].

. In the Chunk definition section of the Define AI parameters page, define the chunks:

.. For Chunking strategy you can choose "sentences", "words", or "characters".
.. For Chunk size you can choose "256 Tokens" at this point.

.Result

The data source is integrated into your knowledge base.
